For the Math Socket you can solve addition subtraction (assumning positive) and mulitplication problems
The client will prompt you to enter a math problem, and will continue to do so until you type "exit". 
The server will receive the problem, evaluate it, and send the answer back to the client. The client will display the answer on the screen.



For the chat socket version 1 you recieve your own message back to you, and for version two it will only go to other clients
